# PLEASE CHECK THE README FILE BEFORE CHECKING THE HOSTED VERSION

## How to see my assessment

First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To see the staging environment open [https://landa-task-dev.vercel.app]

To see the Production environment open [https://landa-task.vercel.app]

This would redirect you to the [http://localhost:3000/users/assessments] page

where you would see the empty state page, to view the populated page 
click create new to pop a modal and then click save. 

to switch back to the empty state kindly click add subject and save.

## Work that wasn't done

1. The Add subject button on the modal
2.  Mobile Responsiveness (Intentional: there was no design for this)
3.  Making the modal work (Intentional: It was said that i should only design the screens which i did without an heavy functionality)

## Things i noted from the design
1. A design system wasn't given, so had to create mine
2. Didn't understand how the participant and failed participant were gotten
